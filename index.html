								<p class="align-justify">HD 209458b is the prototypical hot Jupiter exoplanet and one of the best targets available for 
								precise atmosphere characterisation. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, we studied the atmospheric properties in unprecedented detail. 
								A new data reduction and analysis of the original HST/WFC3 spectrum, accounting for the wavelength dependence of the instrument systematics allowed us to precisely and robustly measure 
								the much-debated H<sub>2</sub>O abundance in HD 209458b’s atmosphere. We combined the newly reduced spectrum with archival JWST/NIRCam data and ran free chemistry atmospheric retrievals over the 
								1.0 − 5.1 μm wavelength range, covering possible features of multiple absorbing species, including CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, HCN, Na, SO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>S. We detected
								H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> robustly at above 7σ significance, and found a 3.6σ preference for cloudy models compared to a clear atmosphere. We used Bayesian model averaging to account for a
								range of different assumptions about the cloud properties, resulting in a H<sub>2</sub>O volume mixing ratio of
