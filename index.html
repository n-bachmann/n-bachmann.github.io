									I am working on better understanding the atmospheres of mainly hot Jupiter exoplanets. I want to see what ground- and space-based observations can tell us about their composition, physical and chemical processes, and dynamics. Therefore I am analysing telescope data as well as working on including 3D effects into forward models for atmospheric retrievals.

								<b>Osiris revisited: Confirming a solar metallicity and low C/O in HD 209458b</b><br>HD 209458b is the prototypical hot Jupiter exoplanet and one of the best targets available for precise atmosphere characterisation. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, we studied the atmospheric properties in unprecedented detail. A new data reduction and analysis of the original HST/WFC3 spectrum, accounting for the wavelength dependence of the instrument systematics allowed us to precisely and robustly measure the much-debated H2O abundance in HD 209458b’s atmosphere. We combined the newly reduced spectrum with archival JWST/NIRCam data and ran free chemistry atmospheric retrievals over the 1.0 − 5.1 μm wavelength
								range, covering possible features of multiple absorbing species, including CO2, CO, CH4, NH3, HCN, Na, SO2, and H2S. We detected
								H2O and CO2 robustly at above 7σ significance, and found a 3.6σ preference for cloudy models compared to a clear atmosphere. We used Bayesian model averaging to account for a
								range of different assumptions about the cloud properties, resulting in a H2O volume mixing ratio of 0.95 (+0.35, −0.17) × solar and a CO2 abundance of 0.94 (+0.16, −0.09) × solar. Both results are consistent with solar values and comparable to predictions from the VULCAN
								1D photochemistry model. Combining these values with a prior on the CO abundance from ground-based measurements, we derived
								an overall atmospheric composition comparable to solar metallicity of [M/H] = 0.10 (+0.41, −0.40) and very low C/O of 0.054 (+0.080, −0.034) with a 3σ
								upper limit of 0.454. This indicates a strong enrichment in oxygen and depletion in carbon during HD 209458b’s formation.
